title: WomenTechWomenYes Project!
---
The Benson Project was the first assignemnt I completed at Metis! We worked in groups of four to help Women Tech Women Yes, a new and inclusive
orginzation, spread word of their upcoming gala. Since they are located in New York City we used the publicly available mta subway data to
narrow down specific subway stations their volunteers could effectively collect email addresses of people interested in their orginization and
gala. Their mission was to spread awareness of their cause and to also garner the interest of individuals already familiar with the tech industry.
