title: How Many Points Will Steph Curry Score in His Next Game?
---
Now that gambling is going to be legal in most states, can I make a model that will make betting a sound investment?<br/>

I wanted to use an OLS Lingear Regression model to predict how many points an NBA All-Star will score in his next game.
I used data from the 2017-18 year and took the rolling mean of any significant stat that I thought would affect the players poimnts
scored in the next game. I also took into account which opponent they were playing the next game since I thought against weaker teams
players would generally score more points. With this limited data I was able to make predictions with an average error of about 6.5 points.
While this isn't the most accurate for predicing precisely how many points a player will score, it might have value for certain bets.<br/>
**Possible Bet** <br/>

<br/>
In this example, I still might be able to predict with higher confidence which player will score more points relative to other players using my model.
<br/>
Moving forward, I would like to incorporate data that doesn't appear on the stat sheet, such as, matchup data and time spent in the city before the game.
This would make me much more comfortable placing bets once it's legal to bet from the comfort of my own couch.
